Title: About me
type: list
---

I am a Cloud Support Engineer II and currently work for Amazon Web Services. I am part of the Linux team and work on various AWS services to solve complex customer issues. I troubleshoot application deployments, recreate customer issues, and build proof of concept applications. My responsibilities also include creating tutorials, how-to videos, and other technical articles for internal and customer communities. 

Prior to joining AWS, I worked at Avaya and was part of the ASP 100 and 4200 product design and development R&D team. I had been actively involved in designing, testing, and deployment of Avaya‚Äôs ASP products. In my first role at Avaya, I used to manage Avaya‚Äôs Highlands Ranch data center. My expertise included data center administration, DevOps and automation, and cloud computing. I have also achieved multiple cloud certifications from AWS and Microsoft Azure.

Prior to joining Avaya, I worked as a Network Engineering Intern at NRG Energy and Finger Lakes Technologies Group. My internship experiences helped me gain skills about customer support, network administration, hardware deployment, and system administration.

Before coming to the US, I worked as a System Administrator at HSBC Software India Pvt. Ltd where I worked on a security related project dealing with electronic communication surveillance.

I received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics Engineering from University of Mumbai and a Masters in Networking and System Administration with a 4.0 GPA from Rochester Institute of Technology.
